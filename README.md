# cpp_OddEven

## To get into file streams we coded system that splits odd and even into two files. 

### Exercise: Odd and Even Files
#### Create 2 files "odd.txt" and "even.txt"
#### Populate these two files with odd and even numbers from 1 to 10000
#### Create another file called "sum.txt"
#### Read in the two numbers from odd.txt and even.txt and add corresponding pairs of numbers 
#### Output the sum to sum.txt
